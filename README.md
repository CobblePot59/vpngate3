VPN Gate Academic Experiment Project is an online service as an academic research at Graduate School of University of Tsukuba, Japan. The purpose of this research is to expand the knowledge of "Global Distributed Public VPN Relay Servers" .

## Why VPN Gate ?
You can take these advantages by using VPN Gate:

    1) You can get through the government's firewall to browse restricted web sites (e.g. YouTube).
    2) You can disguise your IP address to hide your identity while surfing the Internet.
    3) You can protect yourself by utilizing its strong encryption while using public Wi-Fi.

Unlike traditional VPN services, VPN Gate can get through most firewalls.
VPN Gate is free of charge. Not a single registration is required.

## Project Overview
This Python-developed project allows you to quickly connect to the server with the best bandwidth in the country of your choice among those available.
